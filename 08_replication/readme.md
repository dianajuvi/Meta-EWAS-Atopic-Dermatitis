# Replication of previous findings

This section of the project aims to assess whether DNA methylation sites identified as part of the only previous EWAS of AD to date by Quraishi et al., PMID = [26199674](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26199674/). 

Quraishi et al. used random forests to identify 140 CpG sites at which DNA methylation could be used to distinguish between cases and controls. They found "88 out of 140 CpGs had a statistically significant linear association with eczema at age 18 (FDR-adjusted P value < 0.05)". The original PDF table containing the results for all 140 CpG sites can be found in [pmid-26199674_supp-table-1.pdf](data/pmid-26199674_supp-table-1.pdf) and the excel version can be found in [pmid-26199674_supp-table-1.xlsx](data/pmid-26199674_supp-table-1.xlsx).

41 CpGs showed the same direction of effect in a different generation of the same cohort used for the original EWAS. Two of these sites were also associated with eczema status at P<0.05. The data for all 41 CpGs can be found in [pmid-26199674_table-4.xlsx](data/pmid-26199674_table-4.xlsx).


We test how many of the full 140 CpG sites replicate in our meta-analyses.
